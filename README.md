# About Me

Hello! Thanks for stopping by and looking at my portfolio. As the lead data engineer in my current role, I spend a lot of time working with data. Most of my days are spent developing data pipelines, API layers, and AI/ML applications through python, SQL, and javascript via a number of different tools and frameworks. I've been working in and around data since ~2013 when I started my master's program.
